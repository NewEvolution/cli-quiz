  				<h1>My Sister’s Funeral</h1>
  				<h5>by Gerald Stern, 1925</h5>
  				<p>Since there was no mother for the peach tree we did it <br>
					all alone, which made the two of us closer<br>
					though closeness brought its loneliness, and it would<br>
					have been better I think sometimes to be sterile<br>
					from the start just to avoid the pain <br>
					which in my life this far has lasted seventy<br>
					years <span class="highlight">for I am in love with a skeleton<br>
					on whose small bones a dress hung for a while,<br>
					on whose small skull a bit of curly hair<br>
					was strung</span>, and what is dust I still don’t know<br>
					since there was no mother to turn to then and ask<br>
					what else was she wearing, did she have on shoes,<br>
					and were the two trees from Georgia, and was it<br>
					true somebody said the other peach<br>
					should have died instead of her; and I could <br>
					imagine the nose going first though forty years later<br>
					the trees were still there and not as big as you’d think;<br>
					and it was my cousin Red with the flabby lips<br>
					who said it, he had red eyes, a red monstrosity,<br>
					a flabby body, half the house was filled with <br>
					male cousins, they were born in rooms a <br>
					short distance from the rats, I can’t remember<br>
					which ones had the accents nor what his<br>
					Hebrew name was, nor his English.

	  			<h1>Sonnet [Nothing was ever what it claimed to be,]</h1>
	  			<h5>by Karen Volkman</h5>
	  			<p>Nothing was ever what it claimed to be,<br>
					the earth, blue egg, in its seeping shell<br>
					dispensing damage like a hollow hell<br>
					inchling weeping for a minor sea
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="highlight">ticking its tidelets, x and y and z.</span><br>
					The blue beneficence we call and spell<br>
					and call blue heaven, the whiteblue well<br>
					of constant water, deepening a thee,
				</p>
				<p>
					a thou and who, touching every what—<br>
					and in the or, a shudder in the cut—<br>
					and that you are, blue mirror, only stare
				</p>
				<p>
					bluest blankness, whether in the where,<br>
					sheen that bleeds blue beauty we are taught<br>
					drowns and booms and vowels.  I will not.
